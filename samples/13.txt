General system requirements

To install Docker Desktop successfully, your Linux host must meet the following general requirements:

    64-bit kernel and CPU support for virtualization.
    KVM virtualization support. Follow the KVM virtualization support instructions to check if the KVM kernel modules are enabled and how to provide access to the KVM device.
    QEMU must be version 5.2 or later. We recommend upgrading to the latest version.
    systemd init system.
    GNOME, KDE, or MATE desktop environment.
        For many Linux distributions, the GNOME environment does not support tray icons. To add support for tray icons, you need to install a GNOME extension. For example, AppIndicator

        .
    At least 4 GB of RAM.
    Enable configuring ID mapping in user namespaces, see File sharing. Note that for Docker Desktop version 4.35 and later, this is not required anymore.
    Recommended: Initialize pass for credentials management.

Docker Desktop for Linux runs a Virtual Machine (VM). For more information on why, see Why Docker Desktop for Linux runs a VM.
